# bonds is a list of bond types. It's only necessary to specify bonds that are
# unusual in some way (eg, not strength 1). Bond names that aren't specified
# here are assumed to be strength 1.
bonds:
    - { name: B, strength: 2 }

# tiles is a list of tile types. The possible fields are name, edges, color, and
# stoic. Name doesn't actually do anything in xgrow at the moment, but if you
# use stxg.py to generate an xgrow input file, the name of the tilewill be put
# in a comment.
tiles:
    - { name: corner, edges: [ B, 0, 0, B ], color: red  }
    - { name: topboundary, edges: [B, 0, 0, B, v1, v1], color: magenta, shape: "V" }
    - { name: leftboundary, edges: [v1, v1, B, 0, 0, B], color: purple, shape: "H" }
    - { edges: [ v0, v0, v0, v0 ], color: blue3 }
    - { edges: [ v0, v1, v1, v0 ], color: green }
    - { edges: [ v1, v0, v1, v1 ], color: yellow }
    - { edges: [ v1, v1, v0, v1 ], color: tan }

# xgrowargs - arguments for xgrow! In general, this should be intuitive, though
# examine the source of stxg.py if you're unsure. The only ones that aren't
# simple key-value, or true-false, are the following:
# * fission - can be set to off, on, or chunk, corresponding with xgrow options
# no_fission, fission, and chunk_fission.
# * doubletiles - a list of two-item lists, specifying the names of double tile pairs.
# * vdoubletiles - the same for vertical double tiles.
