This is the [Xgrow](https://dna.caltech.edu/Xgrow/) tileset simulator repository.

Xgrow is a C program that, in this repository is wrapped by Python, such that it can be installed with pip, and run (currently through calls to the C program) through Python.

The most recent released version can be installed with `pip install -U xgrow`.  To install from the repository, which has a number of poorly-documented improvements, use `pip install -U git+https://github.com/DNA-and-Natural-Algorithms-Group/xgrow`.  The repository version is currently tested against Python 3.8 - 3.10.
