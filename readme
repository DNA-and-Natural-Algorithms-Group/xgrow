This simulation package for algorithmic self-assembly of tiles
grew out of the xdna/xsier C code from ~/Toys/xal 
and the kinetic model used in ../kinetic

Here, the simulator code and the X display code are separated as much as
possible into xgrow.c (main and X stuff) and grow.c (the model).

old.1 was functionally like xdna ("local equil" Boltzman sampling) but
 with code separated.

old.2 is a working version of the hierarchical kinetic model, but with
 only the Sierpinski rules (exactly the same as kin7 I think).
 the X routine are yet to be generalized, nor can data be collected yet.

12/3/98

old.3 is a working version with hydrolysis added, for investigating
 error-correction.  A routine for flake fission -- removing disconnected
 components -- has been added.

10/12/99

old.4 is ??

old.5 is a working version; linear assembly statistic has been added also.

This directory also contains .m files and data files for the revised
simulations paper.

10/27/01

Current version was modified for 16-bit graphics displays (previous version
core-dumped).  But now some odd things with fission fragments not disappearing.

7/5/02

Modified to read in general tile set definitions by Michael DeLorimier
and Erik Winfree.

Hydrolysis is now a generic option for any tile set.
 Note: Hydrolysis mode doubles the number of tiles. 
 Problem: "mismatch" is w/r to "input" side, which is hard-coded
  to be S-E, as in Sierpinski tiles.  Thus, e.g. binary.tile
  (the binary-counting square) has error-correction problems; it only
  works is Gao=0, indicating no preference for "input" vs "output".

 Gbor is a funny parameter: it changes the relative strength of
  bond type 1, only. (But not other "strength 2" bonds.)  Strictly
  speaking, however, it is for convenience only -- bond strengths
  can be changed arbitrarily in the tile file.
  Gbor WAS REMOVED, NOW THAT STOICHIOMETRY IS SPECIFIED IN THE TILE FILE.

 The following work
  xgrow sierpinsky.tile Ghyd=4 Gam=10 Gseh=7 Gas=25 block=2
  xgrow sierpinsky.tile Gse=6 Gmc=11 Ghyd=10 Gam=6 Gseh=3 Gas=25 block=2
  xgrow barcode.tile Gse=6.3 Gmc=11 block=2 seed=120,120,1 Gfc=15
  xgrow binary.tile block=3 seed=120,120,1 Gse=10 Gmc=19.95 
 The following cause occasional probability errors (Four rose petals)
  xgrow sierpinsky.tile Gas=30 Gam=10 Gseh=8 block=2
  xgrow unary2.tile block=3 seed=120,120,1 Gse=20 Gmc=39
  xgrow binary.tile block=3 seed=120,120,1 Gse=10 Gmc=19.95 Gao=0 Gam=5
  xgrow binary.tile block=3 seed=120,120,1 Gse=20 Gmc=39.9

 Note that the simulator seems to *really* slow down when the space is
  full and there are no moves, or when there is a thin diagonal component
  (is this true?).  Is the problem in the connectivity-testing?
  IDENTIFY THIS PROBLEM FOR SURE, USING gprof, AND FIX IF DEEMED IMPORTANT.
  PROBLEM IDENTIFIED IN simulate(): IF MOST TILE ADDITION SITES CAN ONLY
  ADD TILES THAT ARE NOT "CONNECTED" THEN MOST CALLS TO choose_cell() ARE
  IGNORED, AND FEW CALLS TO change_cell() ARE MADE.

 Also note that connectivity considers 0-strength bonds between adjacent
  tiles to be "connected", as long as both tile types have nominally 
  non-zero sticky-end strengths -- the opposite choice from my 
  recommendation to Renat, which was to consider tiles connected only if 
  the actual bond strength is greater than zero.       
  IT MIGHT BE WORTH CHANGING THIS, IF IT'S NOT TOO HARD
    xgrow AB.tile Gse=8 Gmc=7 block=3
    xgrow barcode.tile Gse=8 Gmc=7 block=3
  demonstrate domain boundaries, where the entire boundary energy is
  zero... and hence in solution (if there really is a zero energy)
  the domain would just fall off... not so realistic...  (although
  this is a real and interesting effect if self-assembly happens on
  a surface, or if there is a slight favorable mismatch energy.)

 It should be possible to simulate the T=1 or T=2 irreversible 
   tile assembly model directly, rather than only the kinetic reversible model.
   THIS SHOULD BE ADDED, USING A FAST PROCEDURE TRACKING OPEN SITES, AS IN
   tiles.el

 It should be possible decrease the "temperature" slowly, simulating an 
  annealing process. Gmc should stay the same, but Gse should decrease, say 
  linearly, with time, at some time constant.  I haven't worked out how
  to correctly choose a next reaction if Gse is linearly decreasing, but
  let's say we only recalculate rates after each reaction, if time has 
  advanced a certain number of seconds (scaled to Gmc).

 Default parameters should be read from the tile file, using the
  same format as the command line (which should overwrite the defaults).

 The tile format in my elisp simulator tiles.el is more convenient:
    binding domains can have interpretable names, and integral strengths
    can be directly specified.  Also, tiles can be given names for
    interpretable diagrams. 
    Another advantage is that tile sets can be built-up by algorithms,
    e.g. the Turing Machine tile set.
    Disadvantages: slow, awkward simulation, ugly, needs random-number
    generator for tile placement.

7/7/02
 EW changed tile file format to assume that the 1st bond (bond type 0)
  has bond strength 0; hence it is not specified, just as tile type 0
  with bonds {0 0 0 0} is not specified explicitly.

 Added file format to read stoichiometry (relative concentrations) for
  each tile type -- this way, for example, border tiles can be at lower
  concentrations.  Gmc still scales all concentrations; stoichiometry
  of 1.0 is assumed if none is given.  
  (Gbor has therefore been eliminated.)

 Handling of the "rose petals" numerical round-off error has been
  improved, so that sums are recalculated from lower levels every time
  they are used.
 
 Remaining Issues on To-Do List (see above for details)
  * Connectivity definition
  * Slow-down due to choosing un-connectable tile additions.
  * Graphics update frequency changed from 
     fixed number of events to fixed simulated time or to fixed real time
  * Convenient tile file format, with command-line type default params
  * Irreversible Tile Assembly Model directly implemented
  * Temperature annealing
  * Following multiple flakes simultaneously
  * Gfc is a strange hack... and it clearly affects the resulting shape...
     but what *is* the "concentration" of a flake?  can it be determined
     better, or estimated, by following multiple flakes?
  * reconsider the hydrolysis model
  * graphical display of tile types, and other information, would be useful
  * choose_cell() in grow.c could make more efficient use of random numbers
  * user-specifiable grid size, and block > 4.

7/16/02
  * added GUI for changing Gse and Gmc during the run.
  * added irreversible Tile Assembly Model.
